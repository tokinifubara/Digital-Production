## INTRODUCTION

This unit introduces you to image editing tools, time-based tools for video content, moving image and sound production and common 3D modelling and animation tools. The unit also introduces to common approaches to media compression and common filetypes.

Digital media production in the creative industries takes in a broad range of practices supported by common software tools and having an understanding of common digital tools and workflows is important to develop a versatile computational practice.

Through workshops and set tasks, you will produce a series of course work tasks that use specific media software. This work will be submitted at the end of the unit for assessment.

## Indicative Content
- How to capture and edit audio and video content
- How to composite visual elements with time-based content
- How to edit sound files and composite sound elements
- Exploring commons file types and approaches to compression
- How to produce and animate 3D assets  

## Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit you will be able to:  
**LO1**         Demonstrate an ability to use common digital media software (Knowledge)  
**LO2**         Demonstrate an ability to edit sound and moving image content (Knowledge)  
**LO3**         Demonstrate an ability to produce 3D assets and animated content. (Knowledge)
